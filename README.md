# Struct-and-Thermal-Work

1) NASTRAN Thermal Analysis 
* Applying a nonlinear gap to a structure with an applied thermal load in NX NASTRAN, comparing the output to hand results. 

2) Simulation_of_a_Fuselage_Floor_under_Loading_Report
* FEAMAP Project

3) Classical_Liminate_Theory_Hw_Project
* Small bi-weekly project
* Used MATLAB to find the running stiffness (ABBD) matrix of the laminate, stress and strains and margin of satefty for individual plys.

3) Senior Design: Computational and Experimental Investigation of the Aerodynamics of a Forward-Swept Wing Compared to the Same Wing with  Aft Sweep and No Sweep Final Report
* Contribution: Section 3.1, First Order Aero Analysis, pg. 25 to 33.
* Section 5.2 - 6.1, Static Load Testing, pg. 57 to 59.  

4) AIAA Competition Project: Hermes Aeronautics Envoy 600 Final Design Report
* Contribution: Section 5, Aerodynamics, pg. 32 to 40.
